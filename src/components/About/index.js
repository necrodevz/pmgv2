We pride ourselves as being a company with heart, designed primarily to provide convenient access to micro-loans for Personal as well as Business purposes. Our business model includes the principles of Peer to Peer lending which is the first of its kind in Jamaica. We therefore provide an Agency function for Mom and Pop lenders whether corporate or individual, large or small (<b>subject to satisfying our rigorous background checks and strict compliance with the provisions of the Anti-Money Laundering legislation</b>) to make a significant contribution in the lives and livelihood of their fellow Jamaicans. We believe that if we can drive success at the Micro level then we will see exponential economic growth and development at the Macro level. Hence we are not only facilitators of direct funding between independent lenders to borrowers but also brokers of crowd funding which allows for qualified lenders to participate with us in the provision of equity funding of viable business projects.</p>
